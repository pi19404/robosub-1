run nmap to see whose on the Anon network (if not that network, the following 
IP address is subject to change) on port 24 (??significance??)
nmap -n -sP 192.168.1.0/24

copy your compressed microcontroller code folder to the sub's PC
scp microcontroller_ctrl_sys.tar.bz2 robosub@192.168.1.4:/home/robosub

if make error,
add export MPIDE_DIR=/home/robosub/mpide to .bashrc (restart terminal 
afterwards) adding this will cause the terminal to run the export command when
a terminal is started

make clean (ALWAYS make clean when sending code to another machine!!)
make
make upload
