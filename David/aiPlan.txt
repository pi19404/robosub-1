What is seen

keep track of time

keep track of what is finished what still needs to be done



loop:
	getInput()
	analyseInput()

getInput() -> Ben Smith

analyseInput() -> David
	
Do Action() -> David
	dictionary with what to do when something found


## Psuedo Code

Start - Figure out 
Gate - write quick program to see gate, run on front camera: 
        recognize gate 
        get corner coords 
        pos = centerCoord(topL, topR, bottomL, bottomR) 
        output <"gate", orange, pos.x, pos.y, pos.z> 
        
          if gate: 
                move(pos) 
Buoy 
Obstacle Course - Use same program as gate look for green instead 
Targets - Look for blue or red with empty circles 
        find the empty circles center point (invert?) 
        determine smaller circle (if 2 circles) 
        send move coord till directly in front of circle 
        send fire command to correct colored torpedo 

bins - fix matching program, have output <"sword", red, X, Y, Z> 
        AI: 
        if not in mission plan move to side of bin to find next one 
        if in mission plan: 
                if centered: 
                        if large enough: 
                                drop correct marker 
                        else: 
                                move down 
                else: 
                        pos = centerCoord(topL, topR, bottomL, bottomR) 
                        move(pos)
